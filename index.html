        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Political ScienceðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Delaney Tate the executive Business Manager at Glossier with five years of managing experience overseeing the production process, helping hire hundreds of dedicated employees to fulfill our company's needs. Specializing in leading teams and creating a safe workspace for employees of all kinds, Delaney utilizes that expertise to always maintain Glossier's image. By focusing on promoting a brand that places an emphasis on the naturalness and simplicity of makeup, Delaney has been able to put the business management degrees she's earned at UC Riverside to good use. Over the years, her strengths at Glossier have garnered some recognition for increasing the company's sales by 10 percent. Delaney may spend her days working hard in the office, but she says "its the joy of helping to promote a brand that seeks to enhance every woman's natural beauty" that gets her going in the morning.<br><br>

    <br>From my early beginnings at Ulta Beauty, I discovered this desire to help woman find beauty products that truly make them feel beautiful. From offering assistance in finding the perfect shade of concealer, to giving my best recommendations for long lasting setting spray, my experience in and around beauty product snot only increased, but my interest peaked. 

After gaining experience at Ulta, I decided to further my leadership by working as a lifeguard at Raging Waters. While working for Raging Waters, I was able to learn crucial skills necessary to properly managing a business, such as leadership, communication, and confidence. 

From Raging Waters, I took my experience elsewhere to help elevate my skills in customer relations. I began working for a company known as Raising Canes. At Raising Canes, I was forced to quickly develop the correct mindset when dealing with customers. In a work environment as fast-paced and chaotic as Canes, I learned that prioritizing a positive customer experience was crucial for the business to thrive in the future. 

A little further down the road, I came to fully put my training to the test as a receptionist for LA Fitness. Alongside my duties of assisting members with any immediate needs, I also made phone calls to renew memberships, clear up any billing invoices, and answer any questions or concerns regarding the state of our facilities. In addition, I was the designated caretaker for children while their parents used our facilities. This required me to develop patience and delegation skills. <br>

        Overall, my previous work experiences have helped to shape and mold me into the top executive business manager that I am today. I also spent 2 years with UC Riverside, most recently as a returning player for the Division 1 Women's Volleyball team where I helped lead the team to dominate the Big West Conference in digs. 

Delaney is also working on earning her Bachelors in Political Science, at the university where she was able to make the Dean's List, as well as maintaining a 3.73 as her overall GPA all while remaining a dedicated student athlete and peer to the students, faculty, and teammates at UCR.
